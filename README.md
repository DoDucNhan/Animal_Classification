# Animal Classification

In this case study, I will perform the analysis on an Animal Classification task. The task is to categorize each animal into one of 151 categories. These steps and techniques in Deep Learning are applied to achieve the desired performance.
- Transfer Learning
- Change of advanced training parameters: Learning Rate, Optimizer, Batch-size, Number of Max Epochs, and Drop-out.
- Data augmentation
- Architectural Changes: Batch Normalization, Residual layers, Attention Block, and other varients.

The [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4HIT2hojJ1bpqoKARiMy0O8tlFlIwYq?usp=drive_link) used in this project contains 6270 images corresponding to animal types. All images are RGB images in .jpg format, 224 pixels wide by 224 pixels high. The images are separated into 151 folders according to their respective classes. 

You can find more details of each step in the [code](https://github.com/DoDucNhan/Animal_Classification/blob/main/Final_solution.ipynb) and [report](https://github.com/DoDucNhan/Animal_Classification/blob/main/report.pdf). A demo is also available through this link.
